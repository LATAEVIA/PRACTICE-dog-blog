  <h2>Catherine's Doggies</h2>
  <p>One of my dogs is small, prancy, and feisty. Her name is Lola. My other dog is also small, but she's slightly less prancy, nervous, and super clingy. Her name is Lexi.</p>
  <h2>LaTaevia's Doggie</h2>
  <p>I had a large dog as a child. I called him Rock. He was very playful and loved tennis balls. He also drooled excessivly and had bad gas.</p>
